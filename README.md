# Victor Hugo | @arctco 🌸

**Environmental & Sanitary Engineer** who accidentally became a developer.  
**Local-first developer** building things that respect your privacy, because not everything needs to be in the cloud.

### Projects in Focus

#### **[cinematique](https://github.com/arctco/cinematiqueandroid)**
My love letter to media tracking. A privacy-focused sanctuary for your movies, TV, and anime. Built to bridge the gap between platforms like Trakt and AniList without sacrificing your data to the highest bidder.

* *Status: v1.7.0 "The Anime Update" is coming soon.*

#### **heartNET**
A short narrative experience about the messages you never meant to send, and the ones you still haven't. Built entirely in Python's Tkinter. It's a retro-internet ghost story about heartbreak and the beautiful chaos of trying to say the right thing when it actually matters.

* *Status: Working on v0.5 "still typing..."*

### What I'm Learning

* **Local-First:** Currently battling API rate limits and sync engines so users can keep their data offline and under control.
* **Narrative Design:** Exploring emotional realism and the "uncomfortable conversation" as a gameplay mechanic.
* **Engineering:** Applying the precision of environmental consulting to the messy world of indie dev.

### Let's Talk About...

**Tech** – Local-first architecture, sync engines, Python/Tkinter limitations, Steam Deck optimization.  
**Media** – Wholesome romance anime, narrative games, or why *The Last of Us Part II* still won't leave my brain.  
**The Process** – Building in the quiet hours between cold coffee and existential dread.

*Made with questionable life decisions, a lot of refactoring and a cat.*
